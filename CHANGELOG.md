# Changelog

All notable changes to models are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Maven Central staging and JReleaser release automation based on the proven
  `integrallis/mfcqi-java` pipeline.

### Changed

- Defined an explicit Maven Central publication allowlist for implemented
  runtime, backend, RAG, embedding, and framework modules.
- Replaced the sibling Vectors composite build with the released Vectors
  dependency so the repository builds and publishes independently.
- Split detailed architecture, module, integration, testing, and support
  material out of the project README.

### Fixed

- Reset the mutable KV cache between independent generations and serialize
  calls sharing one backend.
- Replaced collision-prone BPE merge keys based on `String.hashCode()` with
  full merge-pair keys and added byte-level/ranked-merge regressions.
- Removed unused runtime dependencies and made strict Javadocs, dependency
  locks, staged publications, SBOMs, SpotBugs, and 80% published-module
  coverage part of the release gate.
